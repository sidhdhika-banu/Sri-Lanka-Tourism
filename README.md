# Sri Lankan Tourism Website

This is a basic front-end website for promoting tourism in Sri Lanka. The website showcases popular tourist destinations in Sri Lanka, provides information about the country, and allows users to log in or sign up. The website is responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes. 

### Features:
- **Responsive design**: The website adjusts to various screen sizes.
- **Pages**:
  - **Home**: The landing page with an attractive header and description of the tourism experience.
  - **Places**: A page showcasing various tourist destinations in Sri Lanka, such as heritage sites, wildlife, festivals, and more.
  - **About**: Information about Sri Lanka and the purpose of the tourism website.
  - **Contact**: Contact details and a form for users to inquire about tourism services.
  - **Login** and **Signup**: Allow users to register and log in to the website (these pages are placeholders for future database integration).

### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap (for responsiveness)
- Font Awesome (for icons)
- Google Fonts (for custom fonts)

### Development
This is still a work in progress. The front-end is complete, but the website is not yet connected to a back-end or a database. Future plans include:
- Adding user authentication and connecting to a database.
- Expanding the content on each page.
- Adding interactivity and dynamic features.
